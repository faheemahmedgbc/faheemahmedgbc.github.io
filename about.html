                                <h2>Biography</h2>
                                <p>My name is Faheem Ahmed and I am recent graduate from the Computer Programming Analyst Program at Georgebrown College. 
                                    My background is based around web development, web design, and mobile development. I am generally regarded as someone who takes mindful but competitive approach
                                    when it comes to completing work. I am fueled by my passion for technology and creating new applications.
                                     I am eager to both build on my academic foundations in programming through continued coursework and grow as a person. <br> <br>

                                    I am a firm believer that discipline and practice are the key factors to lead a successful life. I try to emulate that through my work but also through my everyday life.
									I have hobbies which include playing basketball and soccer. I enjoy the outdoors and hope to one day learn how to mountain climb.

                                <p>
                                    My ambition is to secure a career in software development in order to earn a living while working a job that I enjoy. 
                                    By taking classes at George Brown College, I have learned how to create applications, the intracacies of several programming languages
                                    including java,javascript, python and expanded my knowledge in software development. I have gained valuable experience and continue to do so with the 
                                     intention of becoming a software developer.</p>
