                                <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is Stray No More?</h2>
								<p>So, What is Stray No More? Before I get into, I’’ll tell you a little bit about how the idea came to be. My group initially wanted to make an application that would help pet owners find their  lost pets. 
                                    The idea of the application was anyone who thought they had seen a lost pet could take picture and upload it to our application and through their gps location,
                                     it would tag where and when it was seen and surrounding pet owners could look through or communicate with the person who had spotted it to help retrieve it. 
                                     Pet owners could also post if their pets were missing.</p>
                                    
                                    <p> We wanted to create a centralized application where all pet owners could look to see if their pet was missing rather than having to put up posters and other physical means. But this would only fill a small niche. So we had to think of something with a larger scope. And thats where Stray No more Comes in.
                                    
                                    
                                    Stray No More is a mobile application built on our initial idea of helping find lost pets but now caters to helping all animals instead. These can include wild animals like skunks ,or racoons as well as domesticated animals.
                                      We now want our application to be used by animal control and animal shelters as well. 
                                      So if an animal is spotted then, based on the type of animal it is, information will be given to the user on how they should proceed. 
                                      The application will give the user on how to deal with the specific animal. 
                                      They will be given information about where the nearest shelters/animal control centers are based on their location as well as the contact information of those centers. 
                                      Pickups can be arranged with animal control and animals can be moved to shelters if needed. 
                                      This application can be used to help all types of animals as well as help potential lost pets.</p>
                                   <p> So overall, we want to create an application that keeps the public aware of how to handle stray animals, create a community for strays or lost pets, and just help in the wellbeing of animals for the safety of a community.</p>

                                       that has been required thus far. This page will be updated periodically as the Stray No More mobile application is still in development.
